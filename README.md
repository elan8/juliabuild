# Julia Build Without GPL Libraries

This repository contains documentation and scripts for building Julia without GPL licensed libraries using the `USE_GPL_LIBS=0` build option.

## Overview

Julia can be built without GPL licensed dependencies by setting the `USE_GPL_LIBS=0` build option. This creates a more permissive build that avoids GPL licensing restrictions while maintaining core functionality.
